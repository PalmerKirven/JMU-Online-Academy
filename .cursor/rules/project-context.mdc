- Protected routes require authentication
- Admin routes require admin role verification
- Super admin email is hardcoded for additional security

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend
- Built with Next.js App Router
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Role-specific color schemes and UI components
- Dynamic navigation based on user role

### Backend
- Supabase for authentication, database, and storage
- Role-based middleware for route protection
- Helper functions for role verification and user management

### Key Components
- `Sidebar.tsx`: Handles dynamic navigation based on user role
- `middleware.ts`: Manages authentication and route protection
- `supabase.ts`: Provides utility functions for user role management
- Role-specific dashboard components with tailored metrics and actions

## Security Considerations

- Role checks are performed in middleware for protected routes
- Admin routes are protected both on client and server side
- User role changes are logged and can only be performed by admins
- Admin roles cannot be changed through the UI or API for security reasons
- Super admin email is hardcoded and always has admin privileges

## Special Features
